[URGENT]
- Handle L2 ACK
- Handle command handlers for OAM
- Handle recv L2 stats
- Use setenv from forker to set the nodeid in RIOT ... If this works then there wont be any changes in the native riot folder.

[LATER]
- Configurable MAX_PACKET_SIZE ... currently the default is 127. But this can be made runtime.
	currently we have a compile time MACRO, so no worries.
- Handle Lqi, rssi? Does currently RIOT supports use of LQI/RSSI? (Check on RIOT ML)

[BUGS in RIOT]
- ipv6_addr_to_str ... len is not used in strcpy. len is uint8_t. if you pass > 256 bytes then it dfails. Strangely even if i pass 256 as result_len, it fails... 
- gnrc_icmpv6.c icmpv6 receive failure handling needs to release the pkt.
