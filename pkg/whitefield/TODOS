[URGENT]
- Handle L2 ACK
- Handle command handlers for OAM
- Handle recv L2 stats

[LATER]
- Configurable MAX_PACKET_SIZE ... currently the default is 127. But this can be made runtime.
	currently we have a compile time MACRO, so no worries.
- Handle Lqi, rssi? Does currently RIOT supports use of LQI/RSSI? (Check on RIOT ML)

[DONE]
- Use interface IID 

[BUGS in RIOT]
ipv6_addr_to_str ... len is not used in strcpy. len is uint8_t. if you pass > 256 bytes then it dfails. Strangely even if i pass 256 as result_len, it fails...
